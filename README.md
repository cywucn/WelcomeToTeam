### WelcomeToTeam

#### How to Use

The newcomer does **NOT** need to do the procedures below, which are relatively complicated. Only the one who knows how to use Microsoft Teams and wants to equip his/her team with this app needs to do the following. **Newcomers are NOT expected to know anything to use the app.** This app is completely **newcomer-friendly**.

##### 0. Configure SSO for bot

This step is **necessary** because SSO for bot is only possible for those who have already installed this app as a **personal** app.

In the "**Apps**" menu, click "**Upload a custom app**":

Select the `.zip` file contained in the repository.

![image-20210923165134434](README.assets/image-20210923165134434.png)

Add the app.

![image-20210923165209645](README.assets/image-20210923165209645.png)

After adding the app, text the bot "**SSO**".

![image-20210923165345959](README.assets/image-20210923165345959.png)

Then allow the app to sign in on behalf of you. If you receive a bot message "**SSO is configured.**", it means that this step is successful.

When he/she submits it, the self-introduction will be sent to the team.
